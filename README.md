# k8s-node-orders-microservice
A simple Order Service built with Node.js (Express) exposing a few REST endpoints. The real focus is using Kubernetes features: multi-replica deployments, services, horizontal pod autoscaling, config maps for service settings, secrets for DB credentials, liveness/readiness probes, rolling updates, and load balancing.
